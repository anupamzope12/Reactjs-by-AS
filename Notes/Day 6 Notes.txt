2 ways to export

1.export deafult

why default =>with default keryword we can export only one component

const Title = ()=>{
	}
export default Title;

import Title from ""

2.exporting b y name

export const Title = ()=>{
	}

import {Title} from ""

when you are in the same file you don't need to import or export 

every component in react mainatins a state so you can put in all varaible into your state and every time you create your local variable you use usestate in react

useState Hook

supppose you have to create a local variable in react you have to use a state variable and those state variable ijnreacts is known as useState hook

What is state
What is hook?
What is useState?

What is hook?
hook is just a normal function 
but every hook has a specifuic function for it 
 
useState function => to create a state variable
this function returns a array and 1st variable of array is your variable name 

const searchtesxt="KFC" // create a normal variable in jav

const [searchtext] =useState ("KFC")//create local stste vraiable
//Default value 

react says if you want use local variable in react then use useState hook in react

here I am writing the serchtext and here reading the search text this is called as Two way binding

why do we need statevariable => to change the state of variable because react will not understant that thats why we use useState hook
