react give us amzaing functionaliy called useEffect

useEffect is a function but you call it by calling a another function to it
this another function is a callback function 

how you call this useEffect hook by giving this this 2 paramters one is call back function and another is dependency array

callback function means it will not be called immedialy it will call whenever useEffect will be called

there are two ways to render the component => 1 on state change 2 props changes

  useEffect(()=>{
        console.log("call this when dependency is chnage")
    },[searchText])
    
when ever my dependency chnage means seachText change my         console.log("call this when dependency is chnage")
this wiil be called

if I dont pass any dependency it will call only once

when you have a call back function in useEffect hook with empty dependency array it will be called after the initial rendering
