useEffect is a hook which react give us which is called after the componenet is render,it takes  call back function and  is dependency array

component will render use effect will called and then if any changes made then that will be render

if I dont not give a symbol of empty array then my use effect is not depend on any one then my useEffect will be called after each rendering

react says do not create component inside component you can call it inside 

never ever write a useState inside a if Condition
also nerver write is inside a forLoop
never ever write a hook outside a functional component
